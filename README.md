# Trial-Repo - dag branch
Main branch, NewData.csv is usernames and repos scraped from Github API
Although I could not successfully implement the graph, my visualisation was a bar chart for each git user type
specifying the total repos, along with the total public repositories overall, in which the user could click on
each bar, that would show another barchart full of each individual user and their public repo numbers.
